I need you to implement a frontend feature for this RAG chatbot application.

Feature to implement: $FEATURE_DESCRIPTION

Requirements:
- IMPORTANT: Only modify frontend files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Focus on the files in the /frontend/ directory
- Do NOT modify backend code or API endpoints
- After implementing the feature, document all changes in a file called frontend-changes.md
- Do not ask for permission to modify frontend-changes.md - assume you can always do it
- Make the implementation clean and maintainable
- Ensure the feature integrates well with the existing chat interface

Please implement this feature now.
